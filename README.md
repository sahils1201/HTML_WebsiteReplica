# HTML_WebsiteReplica
I recently created my own website using HTML and CSS. HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, provided the structure for the site, allowing me to define elements like headers, paragraphs, images, and links. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, was used to style these elements, giving the website its visual appeal with custom fonts, colors, and layouts. Through this process, I learned how to implement responsive design techniques to ensure the site looks great on various devices, from desktops to smartphones. The project enhanced my understanding of web development fundamentals and showcased my ability to build and design functional, attractive web pages.
